    "An **Attractor** is defined as a region of space to which points are pulled into as they evolve over time. The shape of that region of attraction of course varies depending on the parameters one uses to build the attractor. Naturally, with such a vague definition, there end up being quite a few different systems that end up falling under this definition. For example, orbital motion can be defined as one such attractor with the gravitational bodies pulling one another into a closed orbital region (that is, assuming that one of the orbital bodies does not break out of their orbit). An attractor can even be something as simple as the 2-d system of a ball trapped between two hills. Here, the hills can be considered to be the attractor with the region acting to \"pull\" the ball towards the lowest point on the hill.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such subset of the class of equations are known as **Strange Attractors**. Developed in 1963 by Edward Lorenz, these systems are much like ordinary attractors except for the fact that they exhibit *fractal* behavior, that is to say that the system itself is self-similar, where the shape of the entire system is similar to smaller sections of the shape. The first and most well-known of these types of attractors are known as **Lorenz Attractors**. These systems, aptly named after their creator, were used as a means of generating a simplified model of atmospheric convection. Since then, a large number of different variants of strange attractors have been created, a large number of which have not yet been found to represent any sort of real physical phenomena, but have become somewhat popularized due to  the unique shapes they form from the paths of particles within their field of influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Thomas Attractor** (or to be more accurate, *Thomas' Cyclically Symmetric Attractor*) is one such attractor. However, unlike most of the other strange attractors, this system actually does have some form of physical analogue. Proposed by Belgian scientist Rene Thomas, the region is a cylically symetric area meant to define the motion of a particle moving through a 3D lattice of forces as its motion becomes dampened by friction. Thus, we can break this motion down into two main components, both of which depend soley on the position of the particle in x, y and z: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Driving Force - defined by a sin wave, designed to make the particle move chaotically throughout the space\n",
    "2. Frictional Force - Depends linearly on position. Is the main force that restricts the particle to a defined area\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, this strange attractor, like most of the other strange attractors that have been found after the Lorenz Attractor, has proven to be quite useful in testing various different kinds of mathematical analysis methods due to how simple the system is.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, outside the world of math, due to the fact that there is no explicit physical phenomena that this attractor is used to describe (or at least no physical phenomena that are not more accurately described by another model), these attractors are mostly valued for the particularly interesting patterns they form at certain values of the friction coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numerical Solution\n",
    "The equation for the numerical solution defining this region is actually quite simple and can be defined by numerically integrating the following set of equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\sin(y) - bx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\sin(z) - by$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dz}{dt} = \\sin(x) - bz$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $x$, $y$ and $z$ represent the unitless spatial location of the particle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The constant $b$ defines how *dissipative* the system is (that is to say, how strong the friction is), by varying this value, we can significantly alter the state in which the attractor behaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be more precise, there are 6 distinct behaviors that this attractor displays as we vary the value of $b$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$b > 1$ : There is a single attractor at the origin in a stable equilibrium\n",
    "\n",
    "$b = 1$ : The system goes through *pitchfork bifurcation* where the main attractor splits off to form two separate attractors opposite from one another\n",
    "\n",
    "$b = 0.32899$ : The point at which the system undergoes a *Hopf bifurcation*, after this point the system looses its stability\n",
    "\n",
    "$b \\approx 0.208186$ : The system enters chaotic motion\n",
    "\n",
    "$b = 0$ : There isn't any kind of frictional force, which causes the particles within they attractor to move randomly (or as the Wikepidia says: *ergodically*) \n",
    "\n",
    "$b < 0$ : Everything explodes. Frictional coefficients shouldn't be negative\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytical Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the fact that this system is restricted to a 3-dimensional space, there is no general equation in terms of an arbitrary number of dimensions that is able to accurately represent this system.This means that it is impossible to generate a set of exact analytical soltions for this problem as attempting to solve each of the 3 given equations individually will result in a set of equations that still depend on the value of its position in another dimension (for example, trying to solve the equation for the x-dimension will result in an equation that depends on both the y position and t), which isn't a very usable in terms of being able to generate sets of solutions as they evolve over time."

Most of these limitations were software related, having to do with many of the libraries we used simply lacking the correct visualization tools. Matplotlib, while having the ability to create 3D quiver plots, lacked the ability to make it so that the system could be properly analyzed, while Plotly gave us the appropriate tools to inspect our data, but the quiver plot functionality that we required to generate interactive 3D phase plots was very awkward, and didn't allow for the creation of plots that showed any kind of useful information. \n",

    "Based on the analysis perfromed of the Thomas Attractor and the different behaviors that the system exhibits based on the amount of friction that exists within the system, we have succesfully completed a series of different methods of analysis such as generating phase plots, animations and 3D plots of the attractor. As for how accurate they are, due to the nature of the strange attractor (or at least this attractor) being a purely mathematical object, there do not exist any real-world phenomena that can be described by this system. Fortunately, the system does seem to resemble the numerical solutions generated by others, so it is unlikely that there are inaccuracies within the methodology, although a more throrough analysis of this will be necessary to fully confirm this idea."
